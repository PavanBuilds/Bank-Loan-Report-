# Bank-Loan-Report-
To effectively monitor and assess our bank’s lending activities, we need a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report will provide insights into key loan-related metrics, track trends over time, and support data-driven decision-making. It will help evaluate our loan portfolio’s health, identify risks, and optimize lending strategies.
